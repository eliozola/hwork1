    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 20px;">
      Best known as the creator of the Moomins, Tove Jansson (1914 – 2001) was a Swedish – speaking Finnish cartoonist, painter, illustrator, graphic artist and writer. 
      She was born in Helsinki in a Swedish family of artists – her mother a graphic designer and illustrator, and her father a sculptor. She studied painting both in Finland and abroad while working as an illustrator and drawing cartoons for satirical and political magazines before leaning into her love of nature, animals and changing seasons by charting the adventures of the tightly – knit Moomin family in series of 8 books.
